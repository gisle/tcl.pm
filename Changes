Revision history for Perl extension Tcl.

0.72    20-aug-2003, Vadim Konovalov
        - now widget object become replaced to widget path in arguments to 'call'
        - better error handling and diagnostic for calls to Tcl/Tk
        - now returning undef from handler subroutine do not causes an
          error in Tcl side. Instead, some error traping should be invented

0.71    03-jul-2003, Vadim Konovalov
        - support Tcl version 8.0.x

0.7     02-jul-2003, Vadim Konovalov
        - Some possible coredumps were fixed (but not completely, hence FIXME
          warning in Tcl.xs)
        - some fixes from Slaven Rezic, (FreeBSD support and some more)
        - perl-5.005 support (FreeBSD has this version after installation)

0.6     08-jun-2003, Vadim Konovalov
        - now Tcl 'is-a' Tcl::Tk
        - improved access method for TCL Events (%y, %y and so on)

	  (otherwise Tcl dumps core, as RTFS-ing of Tcl shows)

	  implemented in Tcl.pm and now contains more complex logic.
